(Middle) Global compilation of deep-sea benthic foraminifera 18O isotope records from 40 Deep Sea Drilling Program and Ocean Drilling Program sites (Zachos et al., 2001)  updated with high-resolution records for the Eocene through Miocene interval (Billups et al., 2002; Bohaty and Zachos, 2003; Lear et al., 2004). Most data were derived from  analyses of two common and long-lived benthic taxa, Cibicidoides and Nuttallides. To correct for genus-specifi c isotope vital effects, the 18O values were adjusted by +0.64 and  +0.4 (Shackleton et al., 1984), respectively. The ages are relative to the geomagnetic polarity time scale of Berggren et al. (1995). The raw data were smoothed using a fi ve- point running mean, and curve-fi tted with a locally weighted mean. The 18O temperature values assume an ice-free ocean (-1.0%0 Standard Mean Ocean Water), and thus only  apply to the time preceding large-scale antarctic glaciation (~35 Ma). After the early Oligocene much of the variability (~70%) in the 18O record refl ects changes in antarctic and  Northern Hemisphere ice volume, which is represented by light blue horizontal bars (e.g., Hambrey et al., 1991; Wise et al., 1991; Ehrmann and Mackensen, 1992).

Both snow and temperature anomalies are area averages over the region for which climatological values of seasonal snow-cover frequency (based on the 1973 to 1998 period) are between 10 and 90%. Season is indicated at the top of each panel. Axis for snow anomaly on the left-hand-side y axis, axis for temperature anomaly is on the right-hand-side y axis.

Dashed black curve indicates time-series of nine-point weighted average of area average temperature anomaly. Snow-cover calculations are based on the NOAA/NESDIS snow cover data for the period 1973 to 1998 (updated from Robinson et al., 1993). Temperature calculations are based on the Jones data set, hence anomalies are with respect to the time period 1961 to 1990. Snow anomalies are with respect to the time period 1973 to 1998.

As in the AR5, literature was used to make  expert judgements to assess the levels of global warming at which levels of impact and/or risk are undetectable (white), moderate (yellow), high (red) or very high (purple).  The colour scheme thus indicates the additional risks due to climate change. The transition from red to purple, introduced for the first time in AR4, is defined by very high risk  of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibility, or persistence of climate-related hazards combined with a limited ability to adapt due to the nature of the  hazard or impact. Comparison of the increase of risk across RFCs indicates the relative sensitivity of RFCs to increases in GMST. As was done previously, this assessment takes  autonomous adaptation into account, as well as limits to adaptation (RFC 1, 3, 5) independently of development pathway. The rate and timing of impacts were taken into  account in assessing RFC 1 and 5. The levels of risk illustrated reflect the judgements of the Ch 3 authors.

Plotted are the frequencies of the correlation coefficients (associations) between the timing of changes in traits (e.g., earlier egg- laying) of 145 species and modelled (HadCM3) spring temperatures for the grid-boxes in which each species was examined. At each location, all of which are in the Northern Hemisphere, the changing trait is compared with modelled temperatures driven by: (a) natural forcings (purple bars), (b) anthropogenic (i.e., human) forcings (orange bars), and (c) combined natural and anthropogenic forcings (yellow bars). In addition, on each panel the frequencies of the correlation coefficients between the actual temperatures recorded during each study and changes in the traits of 83 species, the only ones of the 145 with reported local-temperature trends, are shown (dark blue bars). On average the number of years that species were examined is about 28, with average starting and ending years of 1960 and 1998. Note that the agreement: (a) between the natural and actual plots is weaker (K = 60.16) than (b) between the anthropogenic and actual (K = 35.15), which in turn is weaker than( c) the agreement between combined and actual (K = 3.65). Taken together, these plots show that a measurable portion of the warming regional temperatures to which species are reacting can be attributed to humans, therefore showing joint attribution (after Root et al., 2005).","[2, 2, 2.0, 0]","[2, 2, 160, 0]","[0.05, 0, 0.09, 0.01, 4.0, 12.0]","[5, 0, 9, 1, 400, 1200]",-2.4106376,-5.061268,-7.454679,0.7958759,-1.4651853,8.346181

For detailed explanations see Section 6.13. The height of the rectangular bar denotes a central or best estimate value while its absence denotes no best estimate is possible. The vertical line about the rectangular bar with 'x' delimiters indicates an estimate of the uncertainty range, guided by the spread in the published values of the forcing and physical understanding. A vertical line without a rectangular bar and with 'o' delimiters denotes a forcing for which no central estimate can be given owing to large uncertainties. The uncertainty range specified here has no statistical basis and therefore differs from the use of the term elsewhere in this document. A 'level of scientific understanding' (LOSU) index is accorded to each forcing, with H, M, L and VL denoting high, medium, low and very low levels, respectively. This represents our subjective judgement about the reliability of the forcing estimate, involving factors such as the assumptions necessary to evaluate the forcing, the degree of our knowledge of the physical/chemical mechanisms determining the forcing, and the uncertainties surrounding the quantitative estimate of the forcing (see Table 6.12). The well-mixed greenhouse gases are grouped together into a single rectangular bar with the individual mean contributions due to CO2, CH4, N2O, and halocarbons (see Tables 6.1 and 6.11) shown; halocar- bons refers to all halogen-containing compounds listed in Table 6.1. 'FF' denotes fossil fuel burning while 'BB' denotes biomass burning aerosol. Fossil fuel burning is separated into the 'black carbon' (bc) and 'organic carbon' (oc) components with its separate best estimate and range. The sign of the effects due to mineral dust is itself an uncertainty. The indirect forcing due to tropospheric aerosols is poorly understood. The same is true for the forcing due to aviation via their effects on contrails and cirrus clouds. Only the first type of indirect effect due to aerosols as applicable in the context of liquid clouds is considered here. The second type of effect is conceptually important but there exists very little confidence in the simulated quantitative estimates. The forcing associated with stratospheric aerosols from volcanic eruptions is highly variable over the period and is not considered for this plot (however, see Figure 6.8d). All the forcings shown have distinct spatial and seasonal features (Figure 6.7) such that the global, annual means appearing on this plot do not yield a complete picture of the radiative perturbation. They are only intended to give, in a relative sense, a first-order perspective on a global, annual mean scale, and cannot be readily employed to obtain the climate response to the total natural and/or anthropogenic forcings. As in the SAR, it is emphasised that the positive and negative global mean forcings cannot be added up and viewed a priori as providing offsets in terms of the complete global climate impact.","[5, 1, 5.0, 9.0]","[5, 1, 400, 720]","[0.13, 0.16, 0.12, 0, 15.0, 13.0]","[13, 16, 12, 0, 1500, 1300]",9.940063,-0.48355263,-4.0116005,7.5357876,5.627122,8.4240265
